# Description
This work presents a machine learning approach for detecting phishing emails using the Phishing and Legitimate Emails Dataset, a synthetically generated corpus of 10,000 email samples. The study focuses on binary classification to distinguish phishing from legitimate messages, leveraging logistic regression as a baseline model. Unlike traditional datasets, this collection includes enriched metadata such as phishing type, severity, and confidence levels, allowing for enhanced feature exploration. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of logistic regression in capturing key linguistic and structural cues within email text, highlighting its potential as a lightweight yet reliable method for phishing detection in email security systems.
